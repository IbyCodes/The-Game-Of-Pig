# The-Game-Of-Pig
This was a game created in Python where the player can take turns against an AI opponent 


Pig is a very simple, but fun dice game invented by John Scarne in 1945. It is normally played by two
players, and has an interesting jeopardy decision component during each player’s turn.
The rules of Pig are very simple. Two players take turns trying to accumulate points, and the winner is
the first player to reach 100 points. At the beginning of a player’s turn, a separate turn score is started at
zero, and the turn proceeds as follows:
1. The player makes a decision whether to roll (going to step 2) or to hold (going to step 3).
2. If the player decided to roll, he or she rolls a single six-sided die.
1 – Pig out! The player scores nothing this turn, the turn ends, and the opponent’s turn begins.
2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 – The roll is added to the turn score, and the player continues his or her turn at
step 1.
3. If the player decided to hold, the current turn score is added to the player’s total score and his
or her turn ends.
Players can toss a coin to decide who goes first. The first player to end their turn at or above 100 total
points is the winner.
